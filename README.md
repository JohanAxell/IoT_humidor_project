# IoT_humidor_project


## Overview 
### Name and credentials: 
Johan Axell, ja225ik. Christopher Andersson, ca223sq. 

### Short project overview
For this project, the goal is to compose a solution which enables surveillence of enviroment variablables through different sensors. The different variables that will be looked at are the amount of light present, the temperature and the air humidity. These three are the core things to look at in regards to ideal cigar storage conditions. Acceptable ranges for these variables are pre-defined and any deviation from these will trigger a notification sent by email. 

### How much time it make take to do (approximation)
1 hour

## Objective
### Background for chosen project
A long going interest of cigars have always existed in the family. This project along with the sensors included in the firmware that was purchased presented a great oppurtunity to combine this interest and IoT. A humidor, which usually is a box or sometimes a whole room, is something that is primarly used for cigar storage and can often be acquired for a relative decent price. However this solution makes it possible to use other storage enviroments as well, aslong as the variable ranges that is set are adhered to.

### Project purpose
The purpose is a combination of familiarization with the building of an IoT-solution along with facilitation in regards to monitoring different enviroment variables. 

### Project insights
This project and course have definetly provided great new knowledge in regards to basic IOT Concepts, along with programming in python. It has also given me some new insights regarding how to use pybytes and ubidots for data analytics and visualization. These application builders are further discussed below. 

## Material
### List of material needed, including description, price and where to buy. 

**Disclaimer:** The material used in the projects were purchased as part of the LNU - 1DT305 Till√§mpad IoT - FiPy and sensors bundle. However most of what's included isnt used which is why I would suggest the option below. However if one were to be interested in the extras thats included in the bundle, it can be purchased at electrokit.com 

| First Header  | Category | Purchased at | Price |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| FiPy 1.0 | Micro controller  | sparkfun.com  | 77,95 USD  |
| Pycom Pysense 2.0X  | Expansion board  | sparkfun.com  | 34,95 USD  |
| Micro-USB*  | Cable  |   |   |

* Micro-USB had been acquired before project started.
